# 🤖 Introduction to AutoGen

**AutoGen** is an open-source framework developed by **Microsoft** that enables the creation of **multi-agent AI systems**.  
It allows **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, humans, and tools to interact seamlessly through a structured conversation loop.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔄 **Multi-Agent Collaboration** – Multiple AI agents can talk to each other to solve complex problems.
- 🗣 **Conversable Agents** – Agents can send, receive, and respond to messages with human-like context awareness.
- 🔌 **Tool Integration** – Easily connect agents to external tools, APIs, and databases.
- 🧠 **Custom Logic** – Implement your own reasoning, decision-making, and workflow control.
- 📦 **Extensible** – Flexible enough for research prototypes and production-grade applications.

## 🏗 How It Works

AutoGen organizes AI applications into **agents** that communicate via structured messages.

1. **Create Agents** – Define agents with their own personality, capabilities, and configuration.
2. **Assign Roles** – Each agent can have a specific purpose (e.g., code generation, research, summarization).
3. **Exchange Messages** – Agents communicate until a goal is achieved.
4. **Integrate Tools** – Agents can call APIs, run code, or fetch data during conversations.

## 📌 Example Use Cases

- 🛠 **Code Generation & Debugging** – Multiple agents collaborate to write and fix code.
- 🔍 **Research Assistance** – Agents search, analyze, and summarize information.
- 🗂 **Data Analysis** – Agents process datasets, query databases, and generate reports.
- 🎯 **Automated Workflows** – AI-driven project execution with minimal human input.
