# 🗣️ AutoGen Conversational Patterns

AutoGen supports multiple conversational patterns that define **how AI agents interact** with each other.  
Each pattern has its own use cases, benefits, and implementation style.  

---

## 1️⃣ Two-Agent Chat (🤝 Peer-to-Peer)

**Description:**  
The simplest interaction — one agent talks directly to another.

**🔹 Example:**  
- `UserProxyAgent` → asks a question  
- `AssistantAgent` → responds  

**💡 Use Cases:**  
- Simple Q&A  
- Customer support bots  
- Task-specific assistants  

---

## 2️⃣ Sequential Chat (⛓️ Step-by-Step Reasoning)

**Description:**  
A chain of two-agent conversations where the **summary** of one chat is passed into the next.

**🛠️ Workflow:**  
1. Agent A ↔ Agent B (generate summary)  
2. Pass summary to Agent C for the next task  
3. Continue the chain as needed  

**💡 Use Cases:**  
- Multi-step task breakdown  
- Pipeline-style reasoning  
- Passing intermediate results  

---

## 3️⃣ Group Chat (👥 Multi-Agent Collaboration)

**Description:**  
Multiple agents interact **together** under a controller that decides who speaks next.

**🌀 Variants:**  
- **🔄 RoundRobinGroupChat** → Agents speak in a fixed turn order  
- **🎯 SelectorGroupChat** → Next speaker is chosen dynamically via LLM or rules  

**💡 Use Cases:**  
- Brainstorming sessions  
- Debate-style discussions  
- Combining multiple expert perspectives  

---

## 4️⃣ Nested Chat (🪆 Conversations Within Conversations)

**Description:**  
An agent starts a **sub-chat** with another agent **inside** a main conversation — like consulting an expert mid-discussion.

**🛠️ Example:**  
- A research agent consults a knowledge agent before replying to the main conversation.

**💡 Use Cases:**  
- On-demand expert lookups  
- Specialized data retrieval  
- Modular reasoning without breaking the flow  

---

## 🏗️ Architectural Styles in Multi-Agent Systems

These are **structural approaches** that influence conversational patterns:

- 🛎️ **Centralized** → A single orchestrator manages all agents  
- 🔗 **Decentralized (Peer-to-Peer)** → Agents talk directly without a controller  
- 🏢 **Hierarchical** → Supervisor agents manage lower-level agents  
- 📬 **Routing-Based** → Directs tasks to specialized agents based on content

| 🧩 Pattern           | 📜 Description                              | 🎯 Best For                                         |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Two-Agent Chat**   | Direct one-on-one conversation              | Simple Q&A, customer support                        |
| **Sequential Chat**  | Chained chats with carryovers                | Multi-step workflows, progressive reasoning         |
| **Group Chat**       | Multi-agent with a central controller       | Brainstorming, debates, collaborative solutions     |
| **Nested Chat**      | Side conversations inside main dialogues    | Expert lookups, specialized problem solving         |
| **Architectural Styles** | Underlying communication structures     | System design and scalability planning              |

> 💡 **Tip:** Combining these patterns can lead to powerful hybrid workflows.  
> For example, a **Group Chat** with **Nested Chats** allows brainstorming with experts consulted on demand.
