# üó£Ô∏è AutoGen Conversational Patterns

AutoGen supports multiple conversational patterns that define **how AI agents interact** with each other.  
Each pattern has its own use cases, benefits, and implementation style.  

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Two-Agent Chat (ü§ù Peer-to-Peer)

**Description:**  
The simplest interaction ‚Äî one agent talks directly to another.

**üîπ Example:**  
- `UserProxyAgent` ‚Üí asks a question  
- `AssistantAgent` ‚Üí responds  

**üí° Use Cases:**  
- Simple Q&A  
- Customer support bots  
- Task-specific assistants  

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Sequential Chat (‚õìÔ∏è Step-by-Step Reasoning)

**Description:**  
A chain of two-agent conversations where the **summary** of one chat is passed into the next.

**üõ†Ô∏è Workflow:**  
1. Agent A ‚Üî Agent B (generate summary)  
2. Pass summary to Agent C for the next task  
3. Continue the chain as needed  

**üí° Use Cases:**  
- Multi-step task breakdown  
- Pipeline-style reasoning  
- Passing intermediate results  

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Group Chat (üë• Multi-Agent Collaboration)

**Description:**  
Multiple agents interact **together** under a controller that decides who speaks next.

**üåÄ Variants:**  
- **üîÑ RoundRobinGroupChat** ‚Üí Agents speak in a fixed turn order  
- **üéØ SelectorGroupChat** ‚Üí Next speaker is chosen dynamically via LLM or rules  

**üí° Use Cases:**  
- Brainstorming sessions  
- Debate-style discussions  
- Combining multiple expert perspectives  

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Nested Chat (ü™Ü Conversations Within Conversations)

**Description:**  
An agent starts a **sub-chat** with another agent **inside** a main conversation ‚Äî like consulting an expert mid-discussion.

**üõ†Ô∏è Example:**  
- A research agent consults a knowledge agent before replying to the main conversation.

**üí° Use Cases:**  
- On-demand expert lookups  
- Specialized data retrieval  
- Modular reasoning without breaking the flow  

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Styles in Multi-Agent Systems

These are **structural approaches** that influence conversational patterns:

- üõéÔ∏è **Centralized** ‚Üí A single orchestrator manages all agents  
- üîó **Decentralized (Peer-to-Peer)** ‚Üí Agents talk directly without a controller  
- üè¢ **Hierarchical** ‚Üí Supervisor agents manage lower-level agents  
- üì¨ **Routing-Based** ‚Üí Directs tasks to specialized agents based on content

| üß© Pattern           | üìú Description                              | üéØ Best For                                         |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Two-Agent Chat**   | Direct one-on-one conversation              | Simple Q&A, customer support                        |
| **Sequential Chat**  | Chained chats with carryovers                | Multi-step workflows, progressive reasoning         |
| **Group Chat**       | Multi-agent with a central controller       | Brainstorming, debates, collaborative solutions     |
| **Nested Chat**      | Side conversations inside main dialogues    | Expert lookups, specialized problem solving         |
| **Architectural Styles** | Underlying communication structures     | System design and scalability planning              |

> üí° **Tip:** Combining these patterns can lead to powerful hybrid workflows.  
> For example, a **Group Chat** with **Nested Chats** allows brainstorming with experts consulted on demand.

# üìù Summary Methods in AutoGen

In **AutoGen**, **summary methods** determine *how* the conversation history between agents is summarized before being passed to the model.  
This helps manage token usage efficiently and ensures the model stays contextually aware.

---

## üìå Types of Summary Methods

### 1. **`last_message`**
- **Description:**  
  Only the **last message** in the conversation history is used as context for the next interaction.
- **When to Use:**  
  - When you don‚Äôt need the full history.
  - When the latest message contains enough context for the model to respond.
- **Pros:**  
  - Minimal token usage.
  - Very fast.
- **Cons:**  
  - Lacks long-term memory of the conversation.

---

### 2. **`reflection_with_llm`**
- **Description:**  
  Uses the **LLM itself** to summarize or "reflect" on the previous messages, generating a condensed version of the conversation history.
- **When to Use:**  
  - When the conversation is long and context is important.
  - When you want the LLM to maintain a coherent understanding of the discussion.
- **Pros:**  
  - Preserves important details without storing the full conversation.
  - Works well for complex, multi-turn interactions.
- **Cons:**  
  - Slightly higher token usage (due to the summarization process).
  - More computationally expensive.

## üìä Quick Comparison

| Summary Method         | Context Retained         | Token Usage | Speed | Best For |
|------------------------|--------------------------|-------------|-------|----------|
| `last_message`         | Only last message        | Very Low    | Fast  | Short, simple conversations |
| `reflection_with_llm`  | Summarized full history  | Moderate    | Medium| Long, detailed discussions  |

---

üí° **Tip:**  
If you're building an **agent with short interactions** ‚Üí use `last_message`.  
If you're building an **agent that needs memory** ‚Üí use `reflection_with_llm`.
